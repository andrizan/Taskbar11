# Development halted
- Due to the removal of registry tweaks and corresponding effects in Windows 11 the development is currently halted, because functions like setting the taskbar to the top through the registry are no longer working in the latest Windows 11 version(s). 

# Upcoming Features
## Prioritized
- [Halted] Taskview for a top-aligned taskbar (thanks to @Naamloos for submitting [issue 25](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/issues/25))
- Application should not be able to open more than one time (thanks to @Euclidite for suggesting in [issue 14](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/issues/14))
- Audio button in toolbar which opens the old audio mixer (SndVol.exe in system32)  

## Upcoming
- Wi-Fi and Energy-symbol in toolbar (thanks to @Euclidite for suggesting)
- Close to background button that silently continues application without taskbar icon (thanks to @Euclidite for suggesting)

# Taskbar11
<img src="https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/blob/main/Images/Taskbar11_Icon.png">

Change the position and size of the Windows taskbar in Windows 11.

# Description
Taskbar11 customizes the look of the Windows 11 taskbar, which doesn't have any options by default. The taskbar can be set to the top or bottom (default) of the screen, it also allows for setting various icon sizes.

# Usage
Download and launch the executable "Taskbar11.exe". The program is portable.

[Releases](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/releases)

# Requirements
- Windows 11

Possibly works on other version of Windows. However, since Windows 11 is the first version with locked settings there really is no purpose to install it on earlier activated versions of Windows.

# Information
All adjusted registry settings can be viewed in [TaskbarSettingsController.cs](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/blob/main/Taskbar11/Taskbar11/Controllers/TaskbarSettingsController.cs).

# Contributing
Bugs can be reported by opening issues. Ideas to include specific registry settings can also be discussed by opening an issue.
