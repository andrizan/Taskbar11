[Releases](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/releases)

# Requirements
- Windows 11

Possibly works on other version of Windows. However, since Windows 11 is the first version with locked settings there really is no purpose to install it on earlier versions of Windows.

# Information
All adjusted registry settings can be viewed in [MainWindow.xaml.cs](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/blob/main/Taskbar11/Taskbar11/MainWindow.xaml.cs).

Separate documentation will be published soon.
