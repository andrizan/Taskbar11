Change the position and size of the Windows taskbar in Windows 11

# Description
Taskbar11 customizes the look of the Windows 11 taskbar, which doesn't have any options by default. The taskbar can be set to the top or bottom (default) of the screen, it also allows for setting various icon sizes.

# Usage
Download and launch the executable "Taskbar11.exe". The program is portable.

[Releases](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/releases)

# Requirements
- Windows 11

Possibly works on other version of Windows. However, since Windows 11 is the first version with locked settings there really is no purpose to install it on earlier activated versions of Windows.

# Information
All adjusted registry settings can be viewed in [MainWindow.xaml.cs](https://github.com/jetspiking/Taskbar11/blob/main/Taskbar11/Taskbar11/MainWindow.xaml.cs).

# Contributing
Bugs can be reported by opening issues. Ideas to include specific registry settings can also be discussed by opening an issue.
